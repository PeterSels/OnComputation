    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As a young boy, my parents donated me a subscription to \"Kijk\". The magazine called itself \"populair scientific journal\" on the blue with yellow letters cover, but then in Dutch.\n",
    "It still exists. It's online version is published at https://www.kijk.nl.\n",
    "\n",
    "One month, I was probably 15 then, Kijk published a challenge that intrigued me. It was about trying to place as many chess pieces on a board without any being able to catch any other. You have an unlimited amount (or 64 if you want) of pieces of each type. However, pawns do not participate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, if the weight by which you count would be 1 for each type, you'd just put 32 knights on all squares of a chosen color (either black or white) and be done and the score would be 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, instead, each piece is counted with a certain weight depending on its type only. This type weight is equal to one over the number of pieces of that type only you could put on the board without any of the pieces being able to catch any other piece. So a queen would get 1/8 points, as one can put maximum 8 queens on a board without any queen threatening any other queen. The \"Eight Queens\" problem is in fact quite well known. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "A king gets 1/16 points, a rook 1/8 points, a bishop 1/14 points and a knight 1/32 points. The idea of the weights scaling is that, the more 'powerful' a piece is, the \n",
    "fewer one can typically collect on a board and so the harder it is to get many of them, so the higher the reward must be to fit more of them on the final problem. Fitting 8 queens results in a score of 8 * 1/8 = 1 but fitting 8 kings only results in a score of 8 * 1/16 = 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "I puzzled a bit and my dad also helped and then we wrote a letter, which I still remember contained the hand waving argument that \"Surely, the best solution could not possibly be much better than ours.\" A feeling of uncertainty about that claim stuck ... until now, when we actually have some tools and some time to find a better solution and also possibly prove its optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "I still have all my Kijk magazines at home, bundled in 3 dark blue covers, one per year, which you got when you extended your membership with a year. I should look for the results of that contest. I only remember there were quite some people that beat us at it which higher scores. So much for the handwaving argument. But before looking things up, let's try with a MILP solver. So it took 34 years for me to have time to reconsider this gem of a challenge. :)\n",

Only the final problem will have extra constraints, formulating that there cannot be two pieces of different types on the same board square.\n",
