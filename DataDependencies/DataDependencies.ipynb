    "where the CodeMaker then, for each guess by the CodeBreaker, \n",

    "The reason is that the correctly positioned pegs/digits need to be marked as already considered, (in the matched_secret, matched_guess arrays that track of that information) to avoid that digits (both in secret and in guess) which have been matched already will be compared and potentially counted again. Each digit can only be counted at most once (when a match is found).\n",

    "If in calculate_n_correctly_positioned_digits, a digit on position j in the secret \n",

    "but if they are unequal, both will still be used in the second function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a data dependency that imposes hard constraints on the order between some of the comparisons to perform here. This dependency is reflected in the code by the first function potentially writing to matched_secret and matched_guess 1D arrays, which are being read by the second function.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can argue that when the functions are swapped in execution order, that is also the case, which is true, but one would get a different, and not intended result, in a lot of cases. In other words such an order swapped algorithm would not implement the desired behaviour."

    "## Refactored Approach Combining the above Two Loops into One Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "What still feels suboptimal to the program version above is that we have one loop to deduce the digits in the right place and one, after that, to deduce the digits on the wrong place. There is some commonality of body code in those loops. So a nicer program, reusing common code, could result from trying to merge both loops into one. However, we need to maintain the data dependency discussed above to ensure algorithm correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Loop Bodies\n",
    "We notice some similarities in the bodies of the two above functions.\n",
    "In particular:\n",
    "            if matched_secret[j] == '0':\n",
    "                if matched_guess[k] == '0':\n",
    "which occurs in the second function, which one can consider to also add to the first function loop body,\n",
    "since they always evaluate to true, since '0' is the initialisation value for \n",
    "both the matched_secret and matched_guess array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensuring Correct Order of Index-Couples\n",
    "Note that it is still important to execute calculate_n_displaced_digits\n",
    "first, before calculate_n_displaced_digits is executed.\n",
    "So to guarantee that, we will have to execute the indices j and k on the diagonal, \n",
    "where j==k first, before executing any other index-couple.\n",
    "This can be done with 'loop transformation'.\n",
    "More specifically, the lines:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "    for diag in range(0, N):\n",
    "        for on_diag in range(0, N):\n",
    "            j = on_diag % N # say vertical\n",
    "            k = (diag + on_diag) % N # say horizontal\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "below ensure this index-couple order.\n",
    "The added assert statements check at run time that no diagonal index couple\n",
    "is visited after any non-diagonal index-couple has just been visited.\n",
    "It's clear that all index-couples are visited and from those two claims, \n",
    "also that all diagonal index-couples are tested before any non-diagonal index pair is tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for loop transformations like this, I read about it in 1991 from a book\n",
    "of Utpal Banerjee [1],[2], I obtained from the IMEC library as a student. They are very useful\n",
    "for compilers, both if you want to allow the compiler to restructure the code for \n",
    "efficiency in terms of reducing the number of lines. For this, dependency analysis\n",
    "in terms of data flow is important. But also a parallellizing compiler, targetting\n",
    "not one but multiple processing units, can, when they understand this data dependency,\n",
    "derive what operations can be executed in parallel (since they are not interdependent)\n",
    "and which ones cannot (since they have a data dependency and so should be executed \n",
    "sequentially). I remember having this epiphany while reading Utpal Banerjee's book on this\n",
    "and expecially liked the automatic procedure in finding these optimising transformations.\n",
    "Later, on my MSc in Computation at Oxford University in 1995, \n",
    "I took a course in Bulk Synchronous Parallellism (BSP), \n",
    "where it was again one of the major \n",
    "techniques co-invented/discovered by Oxford's Bill McColl in 1992 [3] in obtaining efficient \n",
    "parallellisation, essentially auto-discovering data-dependencies from an even purely seuqntial\n",
    "implementation and from that seeing opportunities for parallallisation (wherever there is no data dependency)\n",
    "and then following the data flow with a 'barrier' of parallel processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case of Master Mind, say we consider the j (4 secret digits) as the vertical axis \n",
    "and the k (4 guess digits) as the horizontal one.\n",
    "Then in step 1, the barrier is a line that starts on the diagonal (where in principle the first function could be executed in parallel on the 4 digits, so say with 4 processors at the same time).\n",
    "\n",
    "In step 2, that line, with the same diagonal slope, is moved right one position and the second function could be executed in parallel again\n",
    "by 4 parallel processors simultaneously. Then in step 3, as well as 4, the line moves right again.\n",
    "In fact, steps 2,3,4 over the 3 * 4 = 12 matrix elements could be executed entirely in parallel, since there are no data dependencies.  That is not to say that the same index-pairs would be visited then (in some\n",
    "schemes more index pairs would be skipped than in others), but the outcome answer: the number of displaced digits (d) would be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimised Implementation\n",
