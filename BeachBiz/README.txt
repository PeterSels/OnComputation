What to update when?

When you changed BeachBiz26.py, you need to update: BeachBiz26.py.gist:
  For local update of file BeachBiz.py.gist, run:
  UpdateRemoteGist.py
  DownloadRemoteGist.py

For local update of tex to pdf file, run compilelatex.sh
  The BEachBiz.tex file also reads the local BeachBiz.py.gist file
