\section{Introduction}

Imagine a person at sea is in trouble and another person on the beach or also in the water wants to save her.
The problem at hand involves finding the optimal path a person should take when transitioning from water to sand
or/and sand to water to reach the destination in the water in the shortest time possible.
Given the different speeds of the person on sand and water,
the problem can be approached mathematically to determine the best strategy.

\section{Sand to Water Case}

\subsection{Deriving the Route and its Total Time}

Given the scenario where a person transitions from sand to water, the total time taken can be derived based on the
distance covered on sand and water, as well as their respective speeds.

Let's assume the following:

\begin{align*}
x_1, y_1 & : \text{Coordinates of the starting point on sand} \\
x_2, y_2 & : \text{Coordinates of the target point in water} \\
x_3 & : \text{Horizontal coordinate where the person enters the water} \\
v_{sand} & : \text{Speed of the person on sand} \\
v_{water} & : \text{Speed of the person in water}
\end{align*}

The time taken for the sand portion is:

\[ T_{sand} = \frac{\sqrt{(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - 0)^2}}{v_{sand}} \]

And for the water portion:

\[ T_{water} = \frac{\sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (0 - y_2)^2}}{v_{water}} \]

The total time is:

\[ T_{total} = T_{sand} + T_{water} \]


\subsection{Derivation of the Derivative and its Roots}

By differentiating \( T_{total} \) with respect to \( x_3 \) and setting the result to zero,
one can find the optimal value of \( x_3 \) that minimizes the total time.

Starting from:
\[ \frac{d T_{total}}{d x_3} = \frac{(x_3 - x_1)}{v_{sand} \cdot \sqrt{(x_3 - x_1)^2 + y_1^2}} - \frac{(x_3 - x_2)}{v_{water} \cdot \sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + y_2^2}} = 0 \]

Multiplying through by the common denominator gives:

\[ (x_3 - x_1) \cdot v_{water} \cdot \sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + y_2^2} = (x_3 - x_2) \cdot v_{sand} \cdot \sqrt{(x_3 - x_1)^2 + y_1^2} \]

Now, we'll square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

\[ (x_3 - x_1)^2 \cdot v_{water}^2 \cdot ((x_3 - x_2)^2 + y_2^2) = (x_3 - x_2)^2 \cdot v_{sand}^2 \cdot ((x_3 - x_1)^2 + y_1^2) \]


%Starting with the relationship:
%\[ (x_3 - x_1)^2 \cdot v_{water}^2 \cdot ((x_3 - x_2)^2 + y_2^2) = (x_3 - x_2)^2 \cdot v_{sand}^2 \cdot ((x_3 - x_1)^2 + y_1^2) \]

Expanding both sides and equating them:

\begin{align*}
& v_{water}^2 \cdot (x_3^4 - 2x_1x_3^3 + x_1^2x_3^2 + x_3^2x_2^2 - 2x_2x_3^3 + x_1^2x_2^2 + x_3^2y_2^2 - x_1^2y_2^2) \\
& = v_{sand}^2 \cdot (x_3^4 - 2x_2x_3^3 + x_2^2x_3^2 + x_3^2x_1^2 - 2x_1x_3^3 + x_1^2x_2^2 + x_3^2y_1^2 - x_2^2y_1^2)
\end{align*}

Grouping terms by their power of \(x_3\):

\begin{align*}
& x_3^4 \cdot (v_{water}^2 - v_{sand}^2) \\
& x_3^3 \cdot (2x_1v_{water}^2 + 2x_2v_{water}^2 - 2x_1v_{sand}^2 - 2x_2v_{sand}^2) \\
& x_3^2 \cdot (x_1^2v_{water}^2 + x_2^2v_{water}^2 + y_2^2v_{water}^2 - x_1^2v_{sand}^2 - x_2^2v_{sand}^2 - y_1^2v_{sand}^2) \\
& x_3 \cdot 0 \\
& \text{Constant} \cdot (x_1^2x_2^2v_{water}^2 - x_1^2y_2^2v_{water}^2 - x_1^2x_2^2v_{sand}^2 + x_2^2y_1^2v_{sand}^2)
\end{align*}

From the above grouping, the coefficients are derived as:

\begin{align*}
a & = v_{water}^2 - v_{sand}^2 \\
b & = 2x_1v_{water}^2 + 2x_2v_{water}^2 - 2x_1v_{sand}^2 - 2x_2v_{sand}^2 \\
c & = x_1^2v_{water}^2 + x_2^2v_{water}^2 + y_2^2v_{water}^2 - x_1^2v_{sand}^2 - x_2^2v_{sand}^2 - y_1^2v_{sand}^2 \\
d & = 0 \\
e & = x_1^2x_2^2v_{water}^2 - x_1^2y_2^2v_{water}^2 - x_1^2x_2^2v_{sand}^2 + x_2^2y_1^2v_{sand}^2
\end{align*}

Putting it all together, we have the \emph{quartic equation}\index{quartic equation}. in \( x_3 \):
\[ a \cdot x_3^4 + b \cdot x_3^3 + c \cdot x_3^2 + d \cdot x_3 + e = 0 \]

Given the complexity of quartic equations, finding its roots can be challenging,
especially if it doesn't factor conveniently.
Hence, we employ numerical methods to find the optimal value of \( x_3 \), as you will see in the python code below.

\subsection{Some Sand to Water Example Scenario's}

Figure \ref{fig:sand_to_water} displays some sand to water scenario's.

\end{figure}

In columns 3 of figure 1, we assume the lifeguard can swim as quickly as he can run on the beach.
In that case, the path with the least time is a straight line.

Compared to that scenario 3, in the two leftmost columns, we assume that the lifeguard runs faster than he can swim.
The results is that for the least-time-path in those cases, he spends more time on the beach
compared to the scenario 3 in columns 3.

In column 4, we assume the probably somewhat unrealistic case that our lifeguard swims faster than he runs.
In that case he avoids spending too much time on the sand, where he is slower than in the water.

\section{Water to Water Case}

\subsection{Deriving the Routes and their Total Time}

\subsubsection{Direct Swim Scenario}

Given the scenario where a person swims directly to the target point in the water, the time taken can be expressed as:

\[ T_{direct}(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, v_{water}) = \frac{\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}}{v_{water}} \]

Where \( x_1, y_1 \) are the coordinates of the starting point in water, \( x_2, y_2 \)
are the coordinates of the target point in water, and \( v_{water} \) is the speed of the person in water.
This time does not have to be optimised as it is not a function of any variable, rather a function of constants only.
However, its time value will be compared to the time taken of another route, as described in the next section.

\subsubsection{Swim to Coast, then Run, then Swim Scenario}

Given the scenario where a person first swims to the coast, runs on the sand, and then swims again to reach the
target point, the total
total time taken for the total route from (x2, y2) to (x3, 0) to (x4, 0) to (0, y1) is:

%    distance_swim1 = np.sqrt((x3 - x2) ** 2 + y2 ** 2)
%    distance_run = abs(x3 - x4)
%    distance_swim2 = np.sqrt(x4 ** 2 + y1 ** 2)
%    t_swim1 = distance_swim1 / v_swim
%    t_run = distance_run / v_run
%    t_swim2 = distance_swim2 / v_swim

\begin{align*}
T_{combined}(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, x_4, v_{water}, v_{sand}) &= \frac{\sqrt{(x_2 - x_3)^2 + y_2^2}}{v_{water}} + \frac{|x_3 - x_4|}{v_{sand}} \\
&+ \frac{\sqrt{x_4^2 + y_1^2}}{v_{water}}
\end{align*}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_1, y_1 \) are the coordinates of the starting point in water.
    \item \( x_2, y_2 \) are the coordinates of the target point in water.
    \item \( x_3 \) is the horizontal coordinate where the person exits the water onto the coast.
    \item \( x_4 \) is the horizontal coordinate where the person enters the water again after running on the sand.
    \item \( v_{sand} \) is the speed of the person on sand.
    \item \( v_{water} \) is the speed of the person in water.
\end{itemize}

The optimization problem aims to find the values of \( x_3 \) and \( x_4 \) (where the person enters the water again)
that minimize \( T_{combined} \). This problem can't be easily solved symbolically, necessitating the use of
\emph{multivariable optimization}\index{multivariable optimization} techniques. This can be seen in the python code below.

\subsection{Some Water to Water Example Scenario's}

Figure \ref{fig:water_to_water} displays some water to water scenario's.

% The figure environment takes care of caption, positioning, etc.
\begin{figure}[htbp] % Positioning options: h=here, t=top, b=bottom, p=page, !=override
    \centering % Centers the image
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{water_to_water.pdf} % The width parameter scales the image to 100% of the text width in this case
    \caption{Water to Water Scenario's.} % Caption
    \label{fig:water_to_water} % Reference label for cross-referencing
\end{figure}

In the left two columns of figure 2, the lifeguard's running speed over sand is larger than his swimming speed in water,
so he benefits from swimming to land, then running along the shoreline and then swimming the last bit to the damsel.

In the right two columns his swimming speed is assumed equal respectively larger than his running speed.
In those cases, the direct swimming route is the fastest option.

I dialogued for 2 days with GPT 4 in
\href{https://chat.openai.com/share/c61447ac-becd-4065-b7b5-c53f00248223}{this session}.
The result is this article including the flawless mathematical derivations (!)
and the fully working Python code (!) below. 90% of text was GPT4 generated. I only added 9% of English text snippets.
My bro in law did the missing 1%: using Midjourney to generate the 2 pictures.

GPT4 is truly astounding in many areas: natural language comprehension,
a high degree of reasoning and its mathematical derivation,
coding and natural language production capabilities. It certainly passes
the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test}{Turing test} in the context of this article.
Or rather, fail it, because its answers are clearly too smart and it responds too quickly to be human,
and in that sense GPT4 is clearly distinguishable from human. But failure is a plus here.

Note that at least today on August 22th 2023, you need to pay 20 USD a month for a chatGPT Plus account.
This accounts allows you to also use chatGPT with the GPT 4 i.o. only the free GPT 3.5 model.
I could not do the mathematical derivation with GPT 3.5. It made a derivation error and I could not resolve
it prompting with GPT 3.5. GPT 4 also made a sign error once, but I could resolve it with some more prompt to GPT 4.

Almost all LaTeX maths snippets were generated by chat GPT 4.
I then pasted them in
\href{https://quicklatex.com/}{https://quicklatex.com/}, pressed the render button there,
and copy-pasted the generated image in medium article here.

Figures 1 and 2 are generated by running: python BeachBiz26.py

A file BeachBiz.pdf, containing more or less the same as this article but in pdf form
is generated by running:./compile\_latex.sh

Python code was pasted in this article via first making a gist from BeachBiz26.py on GitHub.
