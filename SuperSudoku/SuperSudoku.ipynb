    "## Sudoku Model Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "A Sudoku is a quintessential problem to formulate as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. The basic version is also easy to solve. Its mathematical declarative model can be stated as follows.\n",

For the smaller problems of dimension 3 and 4, cplex is faster than CBC, which is faster than gurobi, but we are talking about times in the range: 0.01 to 25 seconds, which is not a long wait. For dimensions 5 and 6, gurobi becomes the fastest solver, then cbc and then cplex. So the order completely turns around. In this range we have solver times from 28 seconds to 282236 seconds (which is 3.26 days), so there waiting time starts to matter."

    "We can very well solve Sudokus by computer now, but in fact Sudokus are created because some humans seem to derive pleasure from solving them with their natural brains. So depriving them from that satisfaction is not a very useful undertaking. Here, we have been reading Sudokus from a json file, but I generated them manually in a pretty much trial and error way. As for both human and computer generation of them, generation of random numbers for some random squares can lead to infeasible Sudoku problems. So clearly something smarter is needed. It could be enjoyable to dabble a bit into that. However, there are plenty to be found on the internet already. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also wonder how a technique like reinforcement learning could solve these discrete optimisation problems. We could have agents per constraint, each trying to satisfy their constraint, without coordination with any other agent. They would receive a reward if their constraint is satisfied or close to satisfied. Would that work? Or, due to the discrete nature of the problem, rather just keep oscillating and never converge to a valid solution? It sounds quite similar to decoupling a MILP approach into an ADMM approach, which also generally has no guarantees to converge to a solution when integer variables are contained in the problem. However, [2] argues it proves convergence for a special ADMM case it set up."
